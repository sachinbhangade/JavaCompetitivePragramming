Sample Input

Sample Output
3
************
Explanation
Cost of Strings:
bbbb= 1+1+1+1=4.
db= 3+1=4.
cc= 2+2=4.
aaabbb = 3.
So there are 3 pairs{ (bbbb, db), (bbbb,cc), (db,cc)) } with same cost.
Note: Your code should be able to convert the sample input into the sample output. However, this is not enough to pass the challenge, because the code will be run on multiple test cases. Therefore, your code must solve this problem statement.
